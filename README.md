# Design Patterns

## Creational Design Patterns

A creational design pattern deals with object creation and initialization, providing guidance about which objects are created for a given situation. These design patterns are used to increase flexibility and to reuse existing code.

- Factory Method: Creates objects with a common interface and lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- Abstract Factory: Creates a family of related objects.
- Builder: A step-by-step pattern for creating complex objects, separating construction and representation.
- Prototype: Supports the copying of existing objects without code becoming dependent on classes.
- Singleton: Restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.

## Structural Design Patterns

A structural design pattern deals with class and object composition, or how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.

- Adapter: How to change or adapt an interface to that of another existing class to allow incompatible interfaces to work together.
- Bridge: A method to decouple an interface from its implementation.
- Composite: Leverages a tree structure to support manipulation as one object.
- Decorator: Dynamically extends (adds or overrides) functionality.
- Fa√ßade: Defines a high-level interface to simplify the use of a large body of code.
- Flyweight: Minimize memory use by sharing data with similar objects.
- Proxy: How to represent an object with another object to enable access control, reduce cost and reduce complexity.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

A behavioral design pattern is concerned with communication between objects and how responsibilities are assigned between objects.

- Chain of Responsibility: A method for commands to be delegated to a chain of processing objects.
- Command: Encapsulates a command request in an object.
- Interpreter: Supports the use of language elements within an application.
- Iterator: Supports iterative (sequential) access to collection elements.
- Mediator: Articulates simple communication between classes.
- Memento: A process to save and restore the internal/original state of an object.
- Observer: Defines how to notify objects of changes to other object(s).
- State: How to alter the behavior of an object when its stage changes.
- Strategy: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class.
- Visitor: Defines a new operation on a class without making changes to the class.
- Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an operation while allowing subclasses to refine certain steps.
