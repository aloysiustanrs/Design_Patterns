# Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
# This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.


# Command is the abstract interface with the execute method.
# LightOnCommand and LightOffCommand are concrete command classes that encapsulate actions of turning the light on and off, respectively.
# Light is the receiver that performs the actual operations.
# RemoteControl is the invoker that holds and triggers commands.
# The client creates the commands and sets them in the invoker to control the receiver's actions.
